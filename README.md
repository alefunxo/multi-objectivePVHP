# multi-objectivePVHP
The first paper will focus on the multi-criteria optimization (cost, CO2) at the local level with a comparative Pareto analysis of housings with different consumption patterns and the respective merits of PV+battery systems; ideally, it would be good if we do get a hold of data of electricity consumption for housings which have heat pumps as heating systems (specially in Switzerland given the trend), as this would make two very distinct clusters besides other parameters such as behavioral aspects that could lead to the identification of different consumption patterns.
